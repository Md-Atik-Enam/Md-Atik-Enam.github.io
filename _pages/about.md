I am **Md Atik Enam**, a PhD candidate in [Human-Centered Computing](https://computing.clemson.edu/hcc/) at Clemson University. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Julian Brinkley](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g4BAX40AAAAJ&hl=en) at Clemson University. I work as a Graduate Research Assistant in the [DRIVE Lab](https://www.drivelab.ai/) at the [Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research (CU-ICAR)](https://cuicar.com/). I have worked on projects funded by **NHTSA, Google, US Army GVSC, and NSF**.  

My research focuses on the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction, Accessibility, Artificial Intelligence, and Usable Security & Privacy**. I leverage Artificial Intelligence in **Human-Autonomous Vehicle Interaction** to create inclusive and accessible technologies for people with disabilities, as well as those who prioritize **usable security and privacy**.  

In my free time, I enjoy ü•æ hiking, üö∂ walking, üèÉ running, and üç≥ cooking. I have hiked more than 500 miles in the USA, yet I feel there are still infinite places left to explore.  

I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate on exciting projects or assist with research that aligns with my interests. If you'd like to connect, feel free to **[email me](mailto:menam@g.clemson.edu)**. üôÇ
